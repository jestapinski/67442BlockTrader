// Have a button send user to https://connect.stripe.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=ca_9PXNKg1qGaTUMW98lIRFkZyjsRV5cPAo&scope=read_write in safari or something, after which we get back info which we can process in back-end and then go back to app

//Phase 0: Be able to create user accounts
//Some simple form to get info from, for this we can just hardcode and build later
//Phase 1: Go through backend to get user info (stripeID) SAT-SUN
//Only when setting up an account
//Take one of hardcoded users and execute OAuth flow
// Redirect using custom URL scheme http://iosdevelopertips.com/cocoa/launching-your-own-application-via-a-custom-url-scheme.html which will give us the URL we redirect to
//https://gist.github.com/amfeng/2314782
//Also, https://stripe.com/docs/connect/standalone-accounts#token-request to get user_id and auth_code

//Take user info -> Go thru Stripe OAuth Flow -> get back stripeID and Auth_token -> Save to DB --> redirect to "Home screen"

//Phase 2: Save user info to user account (Not hard)
//Phase 3: Process payment

/** Saturday (1-4B) and Sunday (5-8)'s Plan of attack for Phase 1 and 2
 1. Start new project, but use same heroku db or just make a new one or something
 1A. New Heroku Project DONE
    1B. New iOS Project DONE
    1.B.1 Install Stripe Cocoapod DONE
 
 2. Create needed entities DONE
 3. Hardcode a user DONE
 
 4A. Register redirect_uri
    4A1. Switch to safari DONE
    4A2. Switch back DONE
 
 4B. App --> Button which opens OAuth in Safari DONE
 
 5. Fill out OAuth stuff and get info back DONE
 6. Ensure redirect goes back to app DONE
 7. Process redirect using logic and get needed elements saved to DB
 8. Display Home Screen (Allow for custom Redirect URI and use a custom Segue)

/** Phase 3 Plan of Attack
 1. Hardcode two users
 2. Get back their stripe_IDs using phase 1 and 2 and save
 3. Set up charge framework on back end
 4. Initiate charge (from some button or something)
 5. Perform charge
 6. Verify charge worked
